This page outlines the steps for inviting a new user. You can invite new users
to your Materialize organization and assign **Admin** or **Member** privileges.

{{< note >}}
You must be an Admin in your organization to invite new users.

## Step 1. Create a new user

1. [Login to the Materialize console](https://console.materialize.com/) and navigate to Account > Account
Settings > Users.

1. Click **Invite User** and fill in the user information.

## Step 2. Determine user Organization privileges

1. Select *Organization Admin* or *Organization Member* depending on what level of organization access the user needs:

    - **Organization Admin**: Can invite new users, edit account
    information, and edit account security information.
    - **Organization Member**: Can login to the console.
      
2. Click the **Invite** button at the bottom right section of the screen.

   Materialize will email the user with a verification link. The user will
   verify their email and create a password for their account. The user will
   then be able to login to the Materialize console.

{{ <note>}}
The **Invite with link** option invites the user as an Organization Admin by
default.
