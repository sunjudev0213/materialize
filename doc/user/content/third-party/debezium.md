[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) works with Materialize in two capacities:

- Debezium adds change data capture (CDC) to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases,
  which lets you propagate data from your database to Materialize
- Debezium's CDC data (known as its envelope) is formatted in a way that
  expresses arbitrary operations (e.g. updates and deletes) on the database's
  data. This envelope is a powerful feature that lets Materialize perform more
  complex analysis by understanding how upstream data is changing.

For the best experience using Debezium, we recommend following the guidelines
outlined here.

### PostgreSQL settings

Materialize relies on Debezium's CDC envelope (which expresses changes to data)
to understand all CRUD-like operations happening in the upstream database.

For Debezium to emit the envelope Materialize expects when using PostgreSQL, the
tables which you're performing CDC on must have the parameter `REPLICA IDENTITY
FULL` set.

For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo
REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

### Open CDC format

You can use Debezium's default CDC envelope or Materialize's Open CDC format, which has been designed to prevent record duplication and sequencing errors. For more information about Open CDC, see [Open CDC](/overview/open-cdc).

### Kafka-less setup

Users who wish to connect a database to Materialize without having to use Kafka can
do so with [tb](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/tb). tb is a tool built by Materialize
that lets you send Debezium data to Materialize using Avro OCF files, bypassing the need
for Kafka. For more information and instructions, see
[tb's GitHub page](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/tb).
