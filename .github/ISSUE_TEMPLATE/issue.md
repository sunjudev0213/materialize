Please make sure you follow the labeling rules for this issue!

1. Assign exactly *one* category label. Is it a bug, a feature, or a musing?

2. If the category is not "musing," assign at least one area label, or more if
   the issue touches multiple areas.

   Don't worry about being exact with the area labels. If an issue is 90% a
   problem with the dataflow layer, but will have some small changes in the
   SQL layer and the glue layer, feel free to just assign **A-dataflow**.

3. Assign **good first issue** if the issue would make a good starter project
   for a new employee. You will be soundly thanked for this when the next
   employee starts!
